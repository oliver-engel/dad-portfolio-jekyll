**About**

For me, painting is an&nbsp; energetic engagement with life's force that is non-verbal and beyond the intellect. I try to find the place where I am acting on impulse and intuition rather that contemplating every move. It is in that space where I find a level of freedom from the work, and allow a deeper level of content to emerge. In the background is a profound interest in human growth and transformation. I am interested in the interplay between the physical and non-physical forces in life that influence our individual and collective and perceptions. I interpret my work through the lens of alchemy, psychology, and mysticism.

In some pieces I use wood panels or thick watercolor paper to create shaped compositions where I cut out and remove the background negative spaces**![](/assets/img/uploads/laying-the-foundations.jpg){: width="1500" height="1000"}.&nbsp;**Even though the work is still two dimensional, the missing background frees the composition from a defined rectilinear space and creates a more dynamic relationship between the subject and the environment it exists in.
