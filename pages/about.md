**About**

For me, painting is an energetic engagement with life's force that is non-verbal and beyond the intellect. I try to find the place where I am acting on impulse and intuition rather than contemplating every move. It is in that space where I find some&nbsp; detachment from the work, and allow a deeper level of content to emerge. In the background of my creative process is a profound fascination with patterns of human growth and transformation. I am interested in the interplay between the physical and non-physical forces in life that influence our individual and collective perceptions. I interpret my work through the lens of alchemy, psychology, and mysticism.<br><br>In some pieces I use wood panels or thick watercolor paper to create shaped compositions, where I cut out and remove the background negative spaces. Even though the work is still two dimensional, the missing background frees the composition from a defined rectilinear space and creates a more dynamic relationship between the subject and the environment it exists in.<br><br>Mark Engel is a contemporary artist working in the San Francisco Bay Area and teaches studio art classes at Mission College in Santa Clara, CA.&nbsp;
